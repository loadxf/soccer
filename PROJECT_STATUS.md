## Recent Implementations

### Data Validation Tests
We have implemented comprehensive data validation tests to ensure the integrity, quality, and consistency of our datasets. The tests cover:

1. **Data Availability**
   - Tests for required data directories
   - Validation of raw dataset files existence

2. **Raw Data Format**
   - Schema validation for Transfermarkt dataset
   - Format checks for football-data.co.uk data
   - Consistency validation between match results and goals

3. **Processed Data Integrity**
   - Tests for presence of processed data
   - Validation of key field integrity (no nulls in IDs)
   - Data type validation

4. **Feature Engineering Validation**
   - Tests for feature datasets existence
   - Validation of feature transformation pipelines
   - Checking for excessive missing values in features

5. **End-to-End Pipeline Testing**
   - Integration tests for the entire data pipeline
   - Validation of pipeline outputs

The validation tests can be run using the `scripts/run_data_validation.py` script, which provides options to run specific test classes or all tests together.

### Data Augmentation Techniques
We've implemented various data augmentation techniques to enhance our model training capabilities:

1. **Class Balancing**
   - Oversampling of minority classes to balance datasets
   - Undersampling of majority classes

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Creation of synthetic match data based on real patterns
   - Preserving team distributions and scoring patterns

3. **Noise Addition**
   - Adding controlled Gaussian noise to numerical features
   - Configurable noise levels

4. **Time Series Augmentation**
   - Creating lagged features for temporal dependencies
   - Rolling statistics (means, standard deviations)
   - Group-based feature creation for teams and players

The augmentation module can be used through the `scripts/run_data_augmentation.py` script, which provides a command-line interface to access all augmentation techniques with configurable parameters.
