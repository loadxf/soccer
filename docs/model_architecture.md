## Overview

The Soccer Prediction System utilizes a multi-model ensemble approach to predict various aspects of soccer matches. The system combines traditional statistical methods with advanced machine learning techniques to provide accurate predictions on match outcomes, scores, and player performances.

The core prediction tasks include:

1. **Match outcome prediction** (win/draw/lose)
2. **Score prediction** (exact goals for each team)
3. **Player performance prediction** (player statistics)
4. **Team form prediction** (team performance trends)

## Model Architecture

The system employs a hierarchical ensemble architecture that combines specialized models to produce final predictions.

### Data Processing Pipeline

Raw data flows through the following stages:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from multiple sources including historical match data, player statistics, team rankings, and league tables.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for prediction models.
4. **Feature Transformation**: Scaling, encoding, and normalizing features.
5. **Feature Selection**: Selecting the most relevant features for each model.

```
Raw Data → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Transformation → Model Input
```

### Feature Engineering

Key engineered features include:

- **Team Form**: Rolling averages of team performance metrics over different time windows (5, 10, 15 matches)
- **Head-to-Head Statistics**: Historical performance between the two teams
- **Player Availability**: Impact of player injuries and suspensions
- **Contextual Factors**: Home/away advantage, tournament stage, derby matches
- **Temporal Features**: Season progress, days since last match, fixture congestion
- **League Position**: Current and recent team positions in the league table
- **Expected Goals (xG)**: Advanced metric for scoring opportunities
- **Team Stability**: Changes in starting lineup and formation

### Model Components

The system uses several model types across different prediction tasks:

- **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: For classification and regression tasks
- **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition
- **Time Series Models**: For temporal trends and seasonality
- **Bayesian Models**: For incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty
- **Statistical Models**: For baseline predictions and interpretability

### Ensemble Architecture

The ensemble combines predictions through a stacked approach:

1. **Level-1 Models**: Specialized models for different aspects (e.g., attack strength, defense vulnerability)
2. **Level-2 Models**: Task-specific models that combine Level-1 predictions
3. **Meta-learner**: Final model that weighs and combines Level-2 predictions
