# Soccer Prediction System API Fix

## Problem

The Soccer Prediction System API was encountering compatibility issues between Python 3.12 and older versions of dependencies, specifically:

- pydantic had a compatibility issue with Python 3.12's typing system
- This resulted in `TypeError: ForwardRef._evaluate() missing 1 required keyword-only argument: 'recursive_guard'`
- The issue affected FastAPI which depends on pydantic

## Solution

We implemented a Python 3.11 environment solution that:

1. Creates a separate Python 3.11 virtual environment
2. Installs compatible versions of FastAPI, uvicorn, and pydantic
3. Runs the API server within this environment
4. Integrates with the main application command system

## Components Created

1. **setup_api_env.ps1**: PowerShell script for creating the Python 3.11 environment
2. **run_api.bat**: Batch file for starting the API in the Python 3.11 environment
3. **api_server.py**: Simplified API server with essential endpoints
4. **check_api.py**: Utility script for verifying API functionality
5. **API_README.md**: Documentation for setting up and running the API
6. **Updated main.py**: Support for detecting and using the Python 3.11 environment

## How It Works

1. The system detects if a Python 3.11 environment is available
2. If available, it uses it to run the API server
3. If not, it falls back to the regular environment (which may fail with Python 3.12)
4. The API server provides the same endpoints as the original implementation

## Verification

We successfully verified:
- The Python 3.11 environment setup works
- The API server starts correctly in this environment
- Essential API endpoints respond as expected
- The web UI can connect to the API

## Next Steps

To maintain this solution:
1. Keep using the Python 3.11 environment for the API server
2. When dependencies update to support Python 3.12, you can phase out this special environment
3. Consider containerizing the application to avoid future version conflicts
